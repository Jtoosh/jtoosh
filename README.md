# Hi, I'm James Teuscher (**Jtoosh**) 👋

CS student @ Brigham Young University focused on building tools that do real good in the world. So far I've worked in turning study + memory concepts into practical interfaces using React & TypeScript, with Python for some scripting and logic. Two years supporting BYU Religious Education taught me reliability, clear communication, and user empathy.

### 🚀 Current Focus
- Ambient flashcard (passive spaced repetition) app
- Python data processing with plans for Typescript UI
- Lightweight performance + debugging habits

---

### 🧩 Core Stack
React • Node.js • TypeScript • JavaScript • Python • Git • Java • ESLint/Prettier  
(Also: custom hooks, component composition, accessibility mindset, troubleshooting)

### 🌟 Projects
**Study Platform** ([byu-cs260](https://github.com/Jtoosh/byu-cs260))  
Flashcard Web App using semantic encoding and mnemonic devices. Reusable components, flashcard functionality and plans for quizing functionality

**Ambient Flashcards** ([note-of-the-day](https://github.com/Jtoosh/note-of-the-day))  
Experiment in subtle spaced repetition. File scraping with JSON storage, with plans for scheduling algorithm for spaced review.
